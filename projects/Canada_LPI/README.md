### 📦 Canada Logistics Performance Index (LPI) Study (2007–2023)

This study investigates Canada's **Logistics Performance Index (LPI)** from **2007 to 2023**, focusing on the key factors influencing changes in its score over time. Using **World Bank LPI data**, we analyze the six core dimensions of logistics performance:

- 📦 Customs
- 🏗️ Infrastructure
- 🌐 International Shipments
- 🎓 Logistics Competence & Quality
- 📍 Tracking & Tracing
- ⏱️ Timeliness

#### 🔬 Research Objective
To determine which LPI components have the **greatest influence** on Canada’s overall LPI score and recommend data-driven strategies for sustained improvement.

#### 📊 Hypothesis Testing

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no significant correlation between Infrastructure and Tracking & Tracing scores.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** There is a significant correlation between Infrastructure and Tracking & Tracing scores.

Using **linear regression**, we obtained a **p-value of 0.1667**, which is **greater than the 0.05 significance level**. Therefore, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**, indicating **no statistically significant correlation** between Infrastructure and Tracking & Tracing scores directly.

#### 📈 Key Findings

While no direct correlation was found between infrastructure and tracking & tracing, a regression model combining both factors yields a **high R² value of 0.797**, indicating a **strong joint correlation** with the overall LPI score.

> _"With an R² value of 0.797, the results show a high level of correlation between these combined scores and Canada's overall LPI score."_
