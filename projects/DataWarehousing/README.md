# 🏗️ Data Warehousing & SQL Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building and analyzing a **data warehouse** to support business intelligence and decision-making processes. Using a star schema design, the warehouse integrates multiple dimensions—such as time, customers, and products—to analyze sales and operational performance.

SQL queries are used to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks, build fact and dimension tables, and generate insights via aggregation and filtering operations.
